# Installing Dependencies

Install pipenv via ```python3 -m pip install pipenv```

Then run `pipenv sync` to install all dependencies. This may take some time because of Tensorflow.

To add more dependencies run `pipenv install {package}`

If you need to run a shell or REPL inside the virtual environment then run `pipenv shell` then once in the shell run `python` to open REPL.
